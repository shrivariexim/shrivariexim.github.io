						<h2>About US</h2>
						<p>Greetings! This is K.Vijaykumar, the properator of Shri Vari Exim, would like to say a few words about our firm and how it emerged and making the business international.
						<br/><br/>
						Early in 1920s, My Grand Grand father Mr B.Bala subramaniam chettiar started the Agro based Business. This is supposed to be the 1st such business during that period in Dindigul. This Business was later followed by one of his Sons Mr. B. Dhasarathan Chettiar during 1940s.  Businesses were done during the British Rule and supposed to be a very hard during their period. The years passed, and his only son Mr. D.Kirubakaran entered and followed his father foot prints from 1962. He developed the business and made the city of Dindigul a surplus food market by bringing the food grains from all over india. His Two sons, Me K. Vijaykumar and K. Sivakumar entered the same field during 1990 and 1993 . Now we are doing the business all around dindigul territory. It's Now 2015 and our sons V.Kirankumar and S.Pankajkumar who are doing the Business Studies are also interested to follow our footsteps to establish our market to worldwide.
						<br/><br/>
						This is the time, we start our Global Agri Business by the name SHRI VARI EXIM were we focus on customer need and quality of food grain that we export. We would like to conclude that we have a vast experiance in this field and the same will be done in Export Trade as well. Expecting all our importers to join our Hands and make the trade a GRAND SUCCESS.</p>
